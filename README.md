# concrete5_page_picker
Like a page list, but allows you to select any number of pages from anywhere in the hierarchy.

## Installation

From c5 root:

`cd blocks/`
`git clone https://github.com/thirtythreedev/concrete5_page_picker.git`

Usage: 

Add block to page, select pages using the left, drag to reorder on the right. Works like a page list, but
doesn't rely on heirarchy to work. 

Quite flexible!
